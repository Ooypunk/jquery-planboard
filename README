jquery based Planboard viewer with events and callbacks for managing planning schedules of many kinds.


How can I see this working:
--------------------------
- checkout from github
- build (For more details on satisfying the dependencies see section "Build Dependencies")
- open src/test/webenv/basic.html in a browser

(when using chrome be sure to add the switch: --allow-file-access-from-files the current in-browser use of loaded local ajax files requires that)



Current state:
-------------
WORKING:
  - visualization of grid, dates, allocations and special periods
    - including scrolling and resizing effects
  - possibility to add dates in front and at the back
  - allow to navigate to a certain date
  - allow to select a new allocation to commit
  - grow and reposition the selection using keyboard events
  - callback methods for clicks on existing allocations or new ones


NOT WORKING:

Build Dependencies:
-------------------
On Ubuntu:
  $ sudo apt-get install make nodejs node-less node-uglify
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
  $ make 

Note: if people have trouble building this distro they can politely ask me (or somebody else) to it for them.
Somewhere down the line I suspect a ready-build distro will be made available.
(I just need to figure out how to best use tags and built-in distribution features on github.com to get the most out of that: ideas welcome)
